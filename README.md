# Purpose

This project is for educational purposes only.

# What you will learn in this repo

This project goes over how to merge two data tables using Pandas as well as how to perform anti-joins to better understand how to quickly see differences between two tables. I will demonstrate this by working through a fun problem -- comparing the differences and similarities between two chemical standards in the USA.

# Data Sources

There are two data sets in this project. The first one is called smart_label_data.csv and it comes from the website `https://www.smartlabel.org`. I acquired this data by manually compiling a table of select ingredients from select brands because this website did not allow for webscraping even though the data is public. That's OK though, you gotta respect that stuff. It only took me a few hours :(

The second dataset comes from the American Cleaning Institute and can be easily retrieved at `https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/industry-priorities/science/cleaning-product-ingredient-safety-initiative` by coping and pasting the table. It is also public data. It's always important to check that! This data set I call cpisi.csv.

## Learning Pathways

If you would like a step-by-step guide that includes exploratory work and explanations of how things work, check out the file `step_by_step_analysis.ipynb` which contains the Jupyter notebook with all instructions. If, however, you just want to see what the final code looks like, you can also see the simplified version in `simplified_analysis.py`.
